                        <p>University of Michigan Electric Boat is a student team that designs, builds, and races a manned electric racing boat to compete in the <a href="http://www.navalengineers.org/Education/Promoting-Electric-Propulsion-PEP">Promoting Electronic Propulsion Competition</a> (PEP) hosted by the American Society of Naval Engineers. PEP is an educational and competitive program to foster the development of electric boats in the United States. Each summer, the PEP competition is held in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.navalengineers.org/Symposia/MACC-2020">Multi-Agency Craft Conference</a>, giving our team the opportunity to show our designs and talk with numerous industry leaders.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Our team offers students the unique opportunity to work on a full-scale boat project. Some challenges we face include designing and fabricating hydrofoils and propulsion pods for efficiency and high-speed performance, building an electrical system for high peak power output, and assembling a solar array.</p>

                <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
                <p>Michigan Electric Boat is established for the purpose of advancing sustainable technology and promoting its capabilities by representing the University of Michigan in the Promoting Electric Propulsion for Small Craft competition. Our mission is to allow members to apply what they have learned in the classroom and improve themselves as students through hands-on projects in engineering, business, and operations.</p>
